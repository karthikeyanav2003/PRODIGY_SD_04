# Sudoku Solver
The provided Python script is a Sudoku solver implemented using the backtracking algorithm. The program offers the user an option to either input a custom Sudoku puzzle or solve a default puzzle. The user interface leverages the tkinter library for basic interaction, and the solver employs a recursive backtracking algorithm to find the solution.

# Tools Used:

# Python: 
The core programming language used for scripting the Sudoku solver.

# Tkinter: 
A standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library for creating the interactive interface where the user can choose to input a custom Sudoku puzzle or use a default one.

# MessageBox: 
Utilized from the tkinter library for displaying dialog boxes to the user, prompting for custom input, and showing error messages.

# Data Structures: 
Lists are primarily used to represent the Sudoku puzzle as a 2D grid, facilitating easy manipulation and traversal.

# Backtracking Algorithm: 
The script employs a backtracking algorithm to recursively explore possible solutions for the Sudoku puzzle. It efficiently handles the constraints of a valid Sudoku arrangement.
